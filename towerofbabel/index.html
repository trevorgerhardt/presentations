        Story from Genesis meant to explain the origin of languages.

        A united civilization that built a towering city.

        God thought what they were building was arrogant and decided to punish their hubris.

        So he scattered them around the world and changed their languages so they couldn't understand each other or accomplish anything.

        What an asshole.

      The Future: ES6<br>

      <small>A language people want to use</small>

      <notes>Don't expect any big changes. Pretty safe to assume it's stable at this point. Stop calling it ES2015, that's just stupid. A lot of the noticeable changes are syntactic sugar. It also standardizes common practices and alleviaates common painpoints.</notes>

        Inheritance. Parent method calling. Constructors. Most importantly a standard way of doing it.
        Don't listen to anyone that tells you otherwise they're being pedantic.
        Don't overuse it, the factory Design Patterns is still helpful, but use the language, work with it, not against it.

      let/const and block scoping
      <pre>
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const j = i // valid
  j = i + 1 // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
}
console.log(i, j) // both undefined
      </pre>

      <notes>
        When converting code to ES6 an easy way to tell code that's been converted is the lack of `var`. There's no need for it anymore.

        Currently must be used in strict mode in V8.
